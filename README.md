# Xiaomi DNS Blocklist

Xiaomi devices (especially phones) are very chatty - imagine that your phone is able to exchange a lot of data with Xiaomi servers and their business partners, mostly without your knowledge.
If you would like to close your smartphone mouth a little, here is a solution - a bunch of domains that you can block using [Pi-hole](https://pi-hole.net/), [AdAway](https://adaway.org/) or other apps.
The list is updated as soon as I notice that my phone connects to a server that is not available on that list yet ;)
